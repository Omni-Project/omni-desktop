# Omni

### About
Omni is a dream analysis/journaling app for mobile and web that allows users to log their dreams, track sleep and dream stats, as well as view their dreams as unique 3D dream "sprites."

For a true Omni experience, users can view their dream sprites in virtual reality using the mobile app. Simply slide your phone into a google cardboard, and look around!

Curious about other people's dreams? Omni presents user with the option to make their dream public to the world. This places your dream (and its dream sprite) into a public 3D realm populated with other dream sprites. Users can fly around, read other people's dreams, and get a peek into someone else's mind.

We invite you to experience Omni for yourself [here](http://omni-project.herokuapp.com)
