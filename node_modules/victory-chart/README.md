VictoryChart
=============

A flexible charting component for React. VictoryChart composes other victory components into reusable charts. Acting as a coordinator rather than a stand-alone component, VictoryChart reconciles props such as `domain` and `scale` for child components, and provides a set of sensible defaults.

VictoryChart includes:

- [VictoryAxis](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-axis)
- [VictoryArea](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-area)
- [VictoryBar](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-bar)
- [VictoryCandlestick](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-candlestick)
- [VictoryErrorBar](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-errorbar)
- [VictoryLine](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-line)
- [VictoryScatter](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-scatter)
