# VictoryChart Changelog

## 18.1.3 (2017-03-15)

- Removes unnecessary props from group components
- Fixes a bug with domainPadding in grouped bar charts

## 18.1.2 (2017-03-14)

[441](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/441)
- Support for better multi-repo tooling

## 18.1.1 (2017-03-10)

- Fixes a bug that was causing unnecessary `VictoryClipContainer` components to be rendered by `VictoryZoomContainer`

## 18.1.0 (2017-03-03)

- Adds `onActivated` and `onDeactivated` callbacks for `VictoryVoronoiContainer`
- Supports `VictoryClipContainer` on all components (as groupComponent)

## 18.0.0 (2017-02-27)

[438](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/438)
**Breaking Changes**
- `VictoryZoomContainer` now zooms both x and y dimensions, use the prop `dimension="x"` to return to the old behavior
- `VictoryZoomContainer` now centers zoom behavior on the mouse position rather than the center of the chart
- `VictoryZoomContainer` has a minimum zoom level of the extent of the domain / 1000. Set a custom minimum with the `minimumZoom` prop, which takes an object with numeric values for x and/ or y.
- `VictoryBrushContainer` no longer has `dimension="x"` as the default value.

## 17.0.1 (2017-02-25)

[437](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/437)
- Fixes a bug with `VictoryZoomContainer` panning behavior

## 17.0.0 (2017-02-25)

[432](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/432)

**This is a breaking change for `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea` charts using the `label` prop**

- Adds `VictoryVoronoiContainer` for hover events (tooltips). `VictoryVoronoiContainer` has several benefits over `VictoryVoronoi` and `VictoryVoronoiTooltip`
  - Supports multi-dataset voronoi
  - Much better performance (voronoi polygons are not actually rendered, so the number of nodes rendered is dramatically lower)
  - Supports multi-data tooltips
  - Supports rectangular selections with a dimension prop
    _i.e._ `dimension="x"` creates vertical hover areas for every unique x value in all child data

- Deprecates `label` in favor of `labels` in `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea`, allowing individual data labels for these components like in other Victory components. This will be a breaking change for anyone using the `label` prop in `VictoryLine` or `VictoryArea`. Series labels will need to be configured manually

- Changes how null values are handled in `VictoryArea`, and groups all line and area segments (i.e. split by null values) into the same `eventKey`, so that they operate as a single line for the purposes of events.

## 16.1.2 (2017-02-05)

- [431](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/431)
- Sets a maximum amount of scale per zoom event for smoother interaction with fast onWheel events

## 16.1.1 (2017-02-03)

- Correct export of `SelectionHelpers`

## 16.1.0 (2017-02-03)

- [429](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/429)
- Throttles `onWheel` and `onMouseMove` events on Victory container components
- Exports container event helpers

## 16.0.1 (2017-02-01)

- [428](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/428)
- Fixes a bug in `VictoryBrushContainer`

## 16.0.0 (2017-01-30)

- [427](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/427)
- Adds `VictoryBrushContainer`
- Adds `VictoryZoomContainer`
- **Deprecates `VictoryZoom`**
- Changes default styles for `VictorySelectionContainer`
- Adds override-able `selectionComponent` for `VictorySelectionContainer`
- Adds `domain` and `standalone` to list of props that get stored in parent state
- Simplifies and standardizes container rendering across components.

## 9.2.1 (2016-06-30)

- Changes helper methods to make horizontal bar chart behavior more intuitive

## 9.2.0 (2016-06-17)

- Supports events on the parent element via the `parent` namespace in the `events` prop.
- `parent` events have access to `width`, `height`, `style` and the calculated `scale` (with `domain` and `range` already applied). Where applicable `parent` events also have access to `data`
- Shared `parent` events are automatically supported in components that use `VictorySharedEvents` by default (_i.e._ VictoryChart, VictoryGroup, VictoryStack)
- When mutating elements via the return from event handlers, mutation objects may now take arrays for `eventKey` to target several individual elements, or the special value "all" to apply changes to all elements of a particular target type
- Fixes a bug related to an incorrect default `tickFormat` for dates
- FIxes a bug related to incorrect axis label placement

## 9.1.3 (2016-06-14)

- Alters the render order for children of `VictoryChart` so that _default_ axes are always rendered before other children. When axes are explicitly defined children of `VictoryChart` will  still be rendered in the order they are defined.
- Alters the render order of elements within `VictoryAxis` so that grid elements are rendered before ticks and tick labels
- Fixes a bug in `VictoryGroup` that was causing custom `labelComponents` of its children to be overridden.

## 9.1.2 (2016-06-13)

- Pre-calculates and applies VictoryAxis transform to individual elements. This allows custom axis components (_i.e._ `tickLabelComponent`) to be absolutely positioned by overriding position props

## 9.1.1 (2016-06-13)

- Custom component props get precedence over calculated props

## 9.1.0 (2016-06-13)

- Fixes bugs related to horizontal bar charts

## 9.0.0 (2016-06-01)

- Upgrades to React 15
- Supports wrapped components
- Updates the events API to support shared events **This is a breaking change for events**

## 8.0.0 (2016-05-13)

 - improves consistency for `labelComponent` and `dataComponent` props. Replaces a custom `SliceLabel` component with `VictoryLabel` to make the api more consistent and predictable. **This is a breaking change for custom label components**, as `VictoryLabel` expects a different set of props than the previous `SliceLabel` component. See [VictoryLabel](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-label) for more detail.

 - Custom components are now supported for all rendered axis elements (axis, axisLabel, grid, ticks, tickLabels)

 - All data and label components now have access to scale so that they can create correctly scaled elements from data i.e. error bars.

- Functional styles and props are now all evaluated before they are passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`, so that custom components will have access to the final values.

- events are bound and partially applied prior to being passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`

- it is now possible to specify `angle` and `verticalAnchor` props for` VictoryLabel` via the style object

- event return values are stored differently on state to facilitate interaction between data and labels. **This is a breaking change for events** as event handlers must now return an object with with `data` and/or `labels` keys so that these values may be applied appropriately to data and label elements respectively.

## 7.0.0 (2016-04-15)

- VictoryBar and VictoryArea no longer support multiple datasets.
- VictoryStack and VictoryGroup define stacked and grouped layouts for their children
- Custom data components supported on for VictoryBar, VictoryLine, VictoryScatter,
  VictoryArea via the `dataComponent` prop
- Enter and exit transitions animate. Enter and exit transition defaults defined
  VictoryBar, VictoryArea, VictoryScatter, and VictoryLine. Custom transitions may be
  defined via the `onExit` and `onEnter` properties of the `animation` prop
- Top level svgs are all responsive by default (using svg viewBox). To render a fixed size
  component, set the `standalone` prop to false and render the component inside an svg tag

## 6.0.0 (2016-03-14)

- Add VictoryArea component
- Add event handling via an `events` prop
- Update to lodash 4
- Update `d3-shape` to the latest version (minor breaking changes on interpolation types)

[more detail](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/84)
- Application dependencies like `radium` and `lodash` now live in components, not in the Builder archetype. This is a breaking change. https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/176

## 3.0.0 (2016-01-26)

- Upgrade to Radium 0.16.2. This is a breaking change if you're using media queries or keyframes in your components. Please review upgrade guide at https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/docs/guides/upgrade-v0.16.x.md
