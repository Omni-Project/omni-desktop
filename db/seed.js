  content: "In the dream, I was in my living room and I looked out the window and it was cloudy. I saw that my ex moved in with a couple of things and he told me how he lied he was going to be homeless so my tenants upstairs decided for him to move in with them. I was so angry. He was wearing white shirt and gray pants. He was also walking bare feet in the house. So I ran into my dad who was in my kitchen. He's cooking soup. He said its for my ex and I told him my ex is stalking me. All of the sudden my ex broken my ceiling and I can see him standing above. He's telling me how angry he was to see me out with my boyfriend and how he watched me had sex. He said how it kills him to hear me moan. So I freaked out. I went upstairs and it was empty but I told my tenants not to believe him but they think I'm rude. Now, I am pulling him out and he refused to move. I cried and told my dad. All of the sudden we are at his job building. Now, I am pulling him out and he refused to move. I cried and told my dad. All of the sudden we are at his job building. He told me I'd be safe in here. I asked him how long do I have to hide in here. When I went back to my house, my ex tampered with my medication and my dads. I started to tell my mom I'm not taking my medication. I freaked out. I was going to call my boyfriend but it felt like he was far from reach. I didn't want him to be angry either. I felt like my mom and dad was no help. I had to try to pull my ex out. So I told my ex to come out right now. He came down the stairs shouting. My head started to hurt. He's cursing me out. He brought down a plastic dish. Then wore his flip flops by the door (now I remember I got flip flops by the door that my bf got me). I told my ex to get out. He was stubborn to leave. I got mad and he got even madder. I try to push him out and he won't leave. I was so terrorized. When I almost got him out the door, I woke up with neck pains and headaches.",

I walk inside out of curiosity. What is Satan selling these days? Is it actual Satanism, or some kind of fad of dark imagery? The sign out front, said in bright blue and pink lettering, “Satanism Store”. I look around and see display cases of sparking jewelry made of precious stones of all colors. I catch a partial glimpse of a pentagram hidden behind a display case. All in all, it seems like a mix of high end jewelry store and some kind of hand metal craft of metal jewelry with different bold designs that seem ancient pagan inspired. I walk pass the jewelry. I believe it is unaffordable, but I do not see any prices. and I am not interested in Satanism, the sparkling jewelry, was some how Satanic, but not openly Satanic, but is jewelry crafted by Satanists for other Satanists. An elderly lady comes up to me and says “I know just what you are looking for, come, let me show what we have back here” She leads me a small shelf full of Mary statues. They look like the miniature versions of the Mary statue at the church I attend. She then shows me a beautiful collection of polished stones: all colors of onyx, there's periodot (green), green aventine, colors of blue, orange, and red. She says, 'See all these beautiful natural stones?' She points out one flat, polished, blue white stone on display she says, 'but this is your stone, because you have Native American blood from which you get your psychic abilities from flowing through your veins.' That stone, I realize must be celestite.",

   {title: 'Queen\'s Sister',
  content: "I saw that I wanted to paint the gate doors of my house. I was supposed to be a queen even though I was no different than I usually am (clothes or appearance or time). Two men were instructing me how to do it. I was holding a brush and I was just using water to practice. I noticed some dust while doing it. They said that I would need help because I have a busy life and did not have a lot of time to do it. I was looking at the gate doors and I thought that they were't big and I could paint them on my own. I could finish in a couple of hours. The color I wanted to paint them was dark blue. Navy blue I guess. The present color is grey and I wanted to refresh it with the blue. Then I was told that my sister who was also Queen (but I was in charge) would not help cause she thought qeens do not do this kind of things. I told them to tell her to come. I saw her coming down from the stairs to me. She was wearing a dress of old age (victorian I guess). She also had a mustache. I did not comment her mustache even though I've noticed it. I told her to paint with me the door gates and work is not a shame. It doesn't matter if we are queens or not. She said that the reason she was not helping was because the gates are wet cause it rained and need to dry first. I looked at them and she was right, they were wet, but I did not admit it and said maybe we can put the primer first. Somehow I wanted her to stay just in case she was trying to find excuses. I also feel that I was in a hurry to start. Someone has already put blue paint on them but it was unfinished and I was asking who did it. I think it was a child. A boy... That's all I remember even though the dream did not finish there.",

  content: "So I was at the Sunshine Coast with a dream friend or two. The city was extremely modern and spacious. There appeared a man made beach with the edge being one step in with the water level unknown. The step made of a common grey speckled bricks with newer houses. I walk along it looking for a good place to enter the water. After a long walk the brick turns to a natural sand. There is more people there some I knew from high school. The atmosphere is overall friendly. not long into the water is a smallish round sand island. I enter the water and swim around there are a few others there. I start to get more slightly to the side of the island because of a current but every thing is fine. After a little while I see two albino diamond pythons half submerged in the water and their heads resting on the slop of the island. I go to stand up in the water however my foot touches a albino diamond python that I can't see and I instantly raise my feet and swim a bit to avoid being bitten. I try again futher down the current but there are more pythons under the water everywhere. My only option is to allow the current to take me to the back half of the island but I don't want to go to the back of the Island and panic. I start to swim frantically towards the island however at this point the current is to strong and I'm not getting closer to the island. So I relax and keep paddling lightly. The sand behind me, the shore line, turns to a dark brown rocky pebble an older style like in brisbane. At half way a long the side of the island I see a short small round edge on the shore line. I reach for it and climb onto it. I need to get to the island and if I dive for it I could under dive and be taken by the current again or I could over dive and hurt myself in hitting the sand. I plan to dive with my face more upwards as to hopefully avoid injury. I do this and successfully reach the island with no problems. There is a crowd still on the island, it is once again a friendly and sunny atmosphere.",

I was in my room, sitting on the bed and my door was open wide, when I felt like someone was watching me. When I couldn't shake the feeling, I went to pierces room to ask him about it and he said he was fine, but then everything changed and I heard the voice of a ghost, it was the one I felt watching me in the hallway. She was African with really dark skin and moldy yellow teeth and knappy hair. She wore a raggedy white dress and i could only see and hear her at this point. Pierce had no idea what was going on. She said she had something important to tell me that couldnt wait and she insisted on being near pierce and touching him. Pierce had no idea what was going on as only I could see and hear her. Suddenly she touched pierce and I saw her for the first time in her physical form. I knew she was in pierces body but I saw her as a dark black woman in a raggedy white dress. She had short knappy hair and her teeth were rotten. She was angry she said and she wanted something. Suddenly it got almost pitch black in the room save for a projection of black people dying from slavery. I think she wanted revenge for it and she told me she need me. I got worried and tried to get her out of Pierces body but she just laughed and said it wouldn't work. She was a witch in her life and this made her a more powerful ghost apparently. Then she disappeared with pierces body as das came home and so I was alone. I tried telling dad but I was crying super hard and he didn't believe me. Then I woke up after saying I needed to tell my friends at school. ",

I screamed for my mom to help me. She was busy. Kept begging. (misunderstanding for some reason). I begged a few more times. She said she would be there in a few minutes. Invisible \"creature\" was way too strong. My strength failed. I was stabbed. (I made the blade hit slightly lower) Wound wasn't as bad as it could've been. I kicked the invisible creature backwards and ran into the room my mom was in. She was horrified to see the knife. I sarcastically thanked her for helping me. Told her to pull the knife out. I wrapped a towel tightly around my neck to stop bleeding. I could hear the creature coming. Told my mom we had to get out of the house. We ran outside, past our vehicles. Told her to take the car. She said it is better to run on foot. I had no shoes or socks on. Snow was on the ground. Severe frostbite and my feet stuck to the sidewalk and roadway as we ran (extremely painful) told her I had no shoes on. Had to warn my dad and two other family members to stay out of the house. Terrifying black shadowy creature stood in the doorway when I went back to the house. Then I realized it was just the lighting. It was one of my family members. I tried to warn them to stay outside, but they didn't. Followed them in. I found my dad and other family member already inside. I begged them to leave the house. Told them it was too dangerous to stay there. They refused. I knew I would have to leave them there. I believe I prayed for their safety and then I woke-up. ",

There was a large cliff/wall and we both almost fell over it and were hanging on the edge, when someone saved us. And we kept walking through this tropical wonderland. When we arrived at our intended destination it was an underground hotel without any windows. We were told we had to shower before entering the hotel.and that once inside we would not be allowed to leave for 4 days. I was frightened by this and felt claustrophobic about being locked in an underground building. I said I didn’t want to go in there. Then I woke up. Feeling sadness and confusions.

After we were sure that everyone that wanted to attend was there, we both accompanied each other for the rest of our evening. Later on that evening, we bumped into him again and then my friend left me by myself with him. We started conversating and I stayed with him for the rest of the night instead. We kept talking, played a few games together, and then I got extremely mad at him for something and went home. Somehow he found out where I lived and came over with an apology and one of the games we were playing. I opened my room door to see him standing there, but slammed it again. I finally came out and forgave him and we continued to talk. We caught a bus somewhere, rode for about an hour talking, and he had to get off at a stop before me. Before getting off he said “ I love you”. I said it back and when he got off, everyone on the bus stared at me like “ What!?!”, then I woke up!",

I searched and searched around every corner of my mind and was left exhausted and felt like in that moment i could die. Suddenly i was thrust into what i perceived to be an astral flight there among the Stars.Against the black the lights were blinding yet warm and beckoning,drawing me deeper into existing without breath,nor sound.just light and wonder and the power of Love. My feet wandered in places without form. My body was free,i felt a little shocked and immersed in light ... everything around me was love. There was someone there as my guide.i dont know who he was or if i had faith in him,however there he was in love and so was I. Only the moon knows just how long,but it seemed to be endless. Until he,my guide,said to me in what seemed to be the deepest loudest soothing,assuring voice.",

  content: "I was at a dinner table with some people still in 19th century and I was making a pot lock breakfast with eggs with vegetables in them, rice and beans mush, I asked everyone if they wanted pancakes and bacon and they said yes. I said I was trying to use all of the left over food from a party my family had that morning. Some kid at the table that looked like Danikan had put all of the eggs in a pan but they were uneven so I was very annoyed. The eggs were all piled up on top of each other so they were growing really tall so I shook them around and they evened out on the pan to make fried eggs but they were not spaced out right. Although I was stressing out and getting flustered, I was trying to get a bacon pan ready but there was too much grease in the pan so I was trying to dump half of it out in another pan, this made me feel so angry. The bacon I had was in the shape and size of sun dresses. I was angry that I could only fit three on the pan at a time but then I was confused as to why they were bacon dresses and then they were regular bacons again. My aunt walked in and was talking to my mom about her financial situation. She told her she must have been upset when I made all of the food because she can't afford it. My mom said she could when my aunt was living there. My aunt said well I'm back but I don't think my mom wanted her to be. My dad looked outside and said oh no hes back and asked me if I remembered the blank license plates. I remembered the man from earlier had blank license plates too. He said he thinks that the guy across the street is also in front of the house. I looked and it was this mime that was wearing a striped outfit but the stripes were orange and green and black. He said that he had heard a lady scream and a dog barking in the front of the house and he thought it was at that guy. I looked on the kitchen buffet table and there was an orange, green, and black striped outfit laying there. I started getting nervous and looked outside and saw an ocean in the background and remembered the flood and saw a vision of an orange and red storm in the clouds with a black eye in the center. Some girl at the table said at least hes pretty cute. Then someone else said no the cutest guy was Jonny Depp and I looked at her funny and fuming because I knew we were in the 19th century and Jonny Depp was supposed to be in the future. I thought what if he was a vampire and had really been alive in this time too.",

It was so hot I could barely think straight and I was dripping buckets of sweat, the bugs were 5X bigger than average fleas. They were still jumping around like fleas, hiding in the carpet, etc. There was flea repellent powder spread on every rug in the house. I see one crawling across my hand. They're FAST and they're huge - something isn't right! Next thing I know I see dozens of them crawling and jumping on my arms and legs, I'm running around trying to brush them off and kill them. Now there are hundreds crawling on my neck, face, arms and legs, they're getting inside my clothes, I'm panicking, I start to get an itchy burn everywhere. Next I realise they are going INTO my body. They are making their way under my skin and probably laying eggs and starting families inside of me, and I can feel all of it happening. I am numb with shock. I wake up!",

  content: "My frst \"WILD\" (wake Enduced Lucid Dream) experience; I'm aware of falling asleep, but still being awake. I could hear the 4.30/5am birds outside. I've read up about WILD so thought I'd give it a go. I went into \"The Zone\" as I call it - the bit between being awake and being asleep - I was also aware of my partner beginning to waken beside me and hoped that wouldn't stop my process. I saw the patterns, but didn't think they were as strong as they've been before. I slipped into a dream state but was well aware of being awake still. I dreamed (although being totally lucid) I was getting into a little boat on the beach. I waved goodbye to someone I knew, but in real life I don't. I had a piece of bright yellow cardboard and kept holding it up to make sure this person could keep sight of me as I went om my journey. I kept shouting to this person 'bye for now' but they couldn't hear me. I tried to call their name, but couldn't remember it as in real life I didn't actually know who they were. I drifted off in the boat, round the corner out of sight of the beach, when I felt a touch scared. I began feeling like I was falling asleep, but knew I couldn't as I wouldn't remember the experience. As I slipped further into darkness, I had the loud buzzing in my ears and the vibrations which are the start of an OBE and I kind of freaked out thinking I'm not ready for this. At the same time, the alarm went off. I just wonder if I'd have relaxed into the situation as I've read I'm supposed to do I'd have had a perfect OBE.",

  content: "My dream starts out with me meeting my best friend from High school at her house for a sleep over. Then somehow, I end up at the local Grocery Store, by myself, with my mother, where I am flirting outrageoously with every man there. Then, My mom & I end up in this dim bookstore and my motheris off talking to someone. I come around the corner and Mom introduces me to this very plain woman with short messy dark hair named Maggie Kelly. Aparently this woman was a friend of my mother's and had placed an ad in a magazine to get pen pals and my mother had been trying to get me to write to her cuz she said we'd be good friends, we had a lot in common. The next scene, I am in a break room or cafeteria type place and this really good-looking guy is watching a local (high school state tournament) boxing match on TV where a HS male buddy of mine his little bro was in the tournament on tv. His boxing gloves looked like white versions of those giant \"Incredible Hulk Fists\" that are a popular toy . I started watching and cheering the boy on, but the room kinda changed and I was in this unfamiliar room with a hardwood floor with this \"Maggie Kelly\", only she was Kate Winslet (who is , of course, beautiful), apparently she had been wearing a dark, messy-haired wig and plain clothes when I met her first. SO, I was like BFF with Kate Winslet and so happy mom had introduced us and a middle-aged male (Ihave never seen him before, but in the dream, he was a friend)came around the corner and he was weARIng a wig and the same outfit as Kate WInslet and looked like a mirror imagage of her. He ended up collapsing, I think he died, and I saw a tear trickle down Kate's cheek; she was so moved that this man had laid down his life for us.",

  content: "Alright just something to keep in mind, there are two groups of people involved in the first part. One group I used to be very close with but the friendship ended abruptly and badly, I will call them bobyX and jimmy X. The other I am friends with still, I will call them RickY and RobY. These two groups know eachother in real life. We were preparing to go to six flags, we are in a car picking people up. I am in a mini van with bobyX and jimmyX, RickY is driving. We are having a good time in the car and are excited. We arrive at RobY's house and there is some discrepency about space in the car. For some reason I stole or borrowed a seat from the car a few days ago but I don't tell them I did, this interfears with my ability to go with them as I tell them I will find a way there. I go to my grandfathers and get side tracked a bit with something or something like that or my car doesn't work, but they are on they're way or are at six flags and I am highly disappointed. I call bobyX and I ask should I still come, and he gives me this unconcerned response and he says it is not fun any more. I am still thinking about going and trying to find a way at this point. Now for some reason, I am in target (the store). I am walking through and there is an older woman manager there who is trying to get me to buy this clock or something of the sort. I tell her no but she is getting rude about it, so she says you'll buy it for sure now, then she puts these price tag stickers on my back, and for some reason that it supposed to implicate that I was trying to steal it. A cop shows up and talks to her, she tells him I was trying to steal it. He gives me a look at first like he is considering that it's true, but then looks at her and says 'how would he have known the price of it?' Or something like that, as to say that he thought she was lying. Then she runs away. Now I am trying to leave because I am still either expecting a call from bobyX or that I want to go call him about going to six flags. I start walking out of target and the same cop stops me for some reason, and he's like 'no no, come on here with me'. He is now trying to get me to put out or put away these Christmas decorations on the shelves in target. I try to explain to him that I don't work here but he won't have it. Then I try to tell him that I donate to charity every month but I stop my self because I remember I didn't for the last two months. Either way I just run away and get outside. I start thinking about six flags again and driving there, but then I remember that I would have had to pay to go there and I just don't care about going anymore and I am no longer concerned about it. Okay now this is the second part of the dream, I feel like I was half awake for this. For some reason, in a dream state I am rethinking about the woman with who tried to frame me at target but I am thinking of it in a different context and aware that I am watching it happen and also narrating it. I am watching myself in an ocean making out with some girl. We both dive under water at separate spots and I see the woman who framed me but now she is a different better looking person and I go make out with her now instead. I feel like I remember the other girl being upset about it. That's the end of the dream.",

All I see is his dark shape. I can see he's there, and feel his presence. He's mean, I can tell that much. He never moves, just stands there, he's just...with me. I've seen him standing in the doorway to my room as a child. Seen him a more back then, a few times in my adulthood. I haven't seen him or thought of him in over a year. Then the night before last I dreamed of him. I was in the car, front seat, with my husband driving. I was holding our brand new baby in my arms. The man was to my right. We were driving fast on this big highway, and it was like a scene from Final Destination. Cars and trucks were crashing into each other, construction sites were blowing up, we sped past it, avoiding being crashed into or hit with anything. We finally made it past it all....only to end up driving off the road like it was a broken or unfinished bridge. We flew through the air, and slowly everything disappeared. My husband, the car, the man. It was me and my baby.... Falling. The air was lifting him out of my arms and I graves onto him so tightly and told him how sorry I was, and how much I loved him. Then....it all stopped. I woke up for a second....I swear my heart had stopped. I was petrified. I had to make sure my baby was still breathing! Then before I knew it I was in this place, I had never seen before. There were rooms, with people I don't like living in them. I couldn't leave, I was like a prisoner there. The man was the boss, I felt like he owned me. I felt like his slave. I had a job to do and idk what it was supposed to be, I just knew I should have been doing something. He was there and I was terrified. My family was gone...I remembered us dying...my older son wasn't even in the dream. But I missed my family. I knew I was being kept from them....I was owned by this man.",
